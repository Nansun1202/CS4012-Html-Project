								<div class="excerpt">
							      <p>To the untrained eye, a grey seal and a common seal may look the same, yet there are key differences. Grey seals are huge. Males can weigh up to 300kg and grow to 2.5 metres long, whereas common seals are almost a third of the size. Grey seal pups are distinctly covered in white fur. Common seal pups, on the other hand, are born with a brown, waterproof coat, making them instantly adapted to swim. The easiest way to tell them apart is through their faces. “The common seals have more of a smushed face like a cat,” explains Hayleigh Gray, an intern at Seal Rescue Ireland in Wexford. “The grey seals have a more elongated snout, more like a dog.”</p>

								<blockquote><p>“Every bit of plastic that’s ever been put into circulation is still in existence today,” says Melanie Croce, executive director at Seal Rescue Ireland. “It’s projected that by the year 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.”</p></blockquote>
								<h2>Fatal Enviroment</h2>
								<p>Seals, in particular, are vulnerable to plastic as they are opportunistic eaters and can easily mistake the fluttering of a floating crisp packet for the silvery scales of a fish. The rescue centre has seen a few cases of seals mysteriously dying, only to later find plastic in their stomachs. The increase in the severity and frequency of storms due to climate change is also a cause for concern. When a large storm hits the Irish coastline, seal pups can become separated from their mothers, leaving them vulnerable to drowning or sustaining injuries from being thrown against the rocks. At this critical stage of their lives, their immune systems are not fully developed and wounds can lead to fatal infections.</p>
								<h2>Overall Importance</h2>
								<p>Seal conservation is important not just for the survival of their species but for the overall health of the environment. They are a bio-indicator species, meaning the condition of their habitat can be determined by the size and robustness of the seal population. Known as the “doctor of the sea”, seals maintain healthy fish populations by picking off sick or injured fish. “The threats that seals are facing are the same threats that everything else, such as whales, dolphins, sea turtles, sea birds and fish, are facing,” says Melanie. “If we can engage the public to protect the seals, then we are actually impacting all of these other species and protecting them too.”</p>
								<h2>Human disturbance</h2>
								<p>Human disturbance is among the key dangers that impact wildlife. “If an animal is deviating its natural behaviour in any way because of your presence, it means you’re too close and that is considered disturbance,” explains Melanie, adding that a 100-metre distance between observers and seals is the recommended minimum. A mother seal may only be a few metres away in the water from a seemingly lonely pup on the beach, and getting too close may cause her to flee and abandon it.</p>
								<p><code>“There are fewer than 350 thousand grey seals worldwide and that’s fewer than African elephants,” says Melanie. “That means that the grey seal population between Ireland and the UK is incredibly valuable from a global perspective.”</code></p>
								<p>Seal conservation represents wildlife conservation at large. The species can be protected by short-term solutions includes:</p>
